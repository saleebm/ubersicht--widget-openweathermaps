# Acknowledgements:

Thank you [Li Xueli](https://github.com/mixj93) for the base code found [here](https://github.com/mixj93/uebersicht-weather-widget). I simply modified it so that it would work with Open Weather Maps since the DarkSky API has gone corporate ([see issue here](https://github.com/mixj93/uebersicht-weather-widget/issues/2)). I also removed the toggle to open and close the daily weather.

# Installation

Please obtain an API from [Open Weather Maps by signing up here](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).

Location info is automatically obtained using geolocation, but you may modify it to your liking. In addition, you may specify metric or imperial units.
